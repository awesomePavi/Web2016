					During this Hackathon I had the opportunity to listen to a few researchers speak. During a presentation on data inquiry and collection, a researcher began to speak of the problems with sending out multi-100 question questionnaires asking people what they ate. This appeled to me because I believed that instead of sending out a thick questionnaire to an household hoping for it to be sent back; why not make a non intrusive application with a prompt every so often asking users to enter what they ate instead of making them read through 100s of foods. So I set out and began my work. I thought it was something that I could do on my own, but after 24 hours and a lot of coffee I was only able to achieve half of what I wanted to accomplish. I may not have placed but had many inquires on my application

					As my first Hackathon it was daunting going to Harvard. I though I could do it all by myself telling myself “it was just like a school project”, “I’ll end up coding it all anyway”. The most important lesson that I learned from this is that when you are on a deadline, nothing is more important then a good team and proper delegation.

					This was the first time I had created an android application. In the end the applicaiton had less then half of the features I expected it to have; but for a first app it was ok.

					This even taught me that no matter what any idea can be improved. Many people asked me to be apart of their team but I declined for the product already existed in some form or another. What I learned was that even though a product may already exist less intrusive, less expensive and more effective systems can be made.
