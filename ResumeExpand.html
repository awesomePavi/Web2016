     The contest consisted of 5 questions ranging from easy to hard, and you had to create an algorithm to solve the problem and get the correct output. I had placed in the top 50 earning me a position in the finals; which had come as a shock to me because I had done the preliminary round for fun in an attempt to kill time between classes. Sadly, I did not place in the top 3 the winners consisted of masters and PHD students who specialized in algorithm design.    </td>

     During this Hackathon I had the opportunity to listen to a few researchers speak. During a presentation on data inquiry and collection, a researcher began to speak of the problems with sending out multi-100 question questionnaires asking people what they ate. This appeled to me because I believed that instead of sending out a thick questionnaire to an household hoping for it to be sent back; why not make a non intrusive application with a prompt every so often asking users to enter what they ate instead of making them read through 100s of foods. So I set out and began my work. I thought it was something that I could do on my own, but after 24 hours and a lot of coffee I was only able to achieve half of what I wanted to accomplish. I may not have placed but had many inquires on my application    </td>

     As my first Hackathon it was daunting going to Harvard. I though I could do it all by myself telling myself  it was just like a school project ,  I ll end up coding it all anyway . The most important lesson that I learned from this is that when you are on a deadline, nothing is more important then a good team and proper delegation.     </td>

     This even taught me that no matter what any idea can be improved. Many people asked me to be apart of their team but I declined for the product already existed in some form or another. What I learned was that even though a product may already exist less intrusive, less expensive and more effective systems can be made.    </td>
